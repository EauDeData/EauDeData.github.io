                    Content Retrieval in Scanned Documents (Under Review)</h4>
                <p>
                  In this work, we address the limitations of current approaches to document retrieval by incorporating vision-based topic extraction. While previous methods have primarily focused on visual elements or relied on optical character recognition (OCR) for text extraction, we propose a paradigm shift by directly incorporating vision into the topic space. We demonstrate that recognizing all visual elements within a document is unnecessary for identifying its underlying topic, and visual cues such as icons, writing style, and font can serve as sufficient indicators. By leveraging ranking loss functions and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we learn complex topological representations that mimic the behavior of text representations. Our approach eliminates the need for OCR and its associated challenges, including efficiency, performance, data-hunger, and expensive annotation. We evaluate the performance of our vision encoder for document retrieval in various scenarios, including OCR-based and OCR-free modalities, and demonstrate its accuracy and rank correlation. Furthermore, we highlight the significance of incorporating vision in historical documentation, where visually antiquated documents contain valuable cues. Our research contributes to the understanding of topic extraction from a vision perspective and offers insights into annotation-cheap document retrieval systems.

                <h4>Date Estimation in the Wild of Scanned Historical Photos: An Image Retrieval Approach (ICDAR 2021)</h4>
                <p class="abstract">
                    Date estimation of historical document images is a challenging problem, with several contributions in the literature that lack the ability to generalize from one dataset to others. This paper presents a robust date estimation system based on a retrieval approach that generalizes well in front of heterogeneous collections. We use a ranking loss function named smooth-nDCG to train a Convolutional Neural Network that learns an ordination of documents for each problem. One of the main usages of the presented approach is as a tool for historical contextual retrieval. It means that scholars could perform comparative analysis of historical images from big datasets in terms of the period where they were produced. We provide experimental evaluation on different types of documents from real datasets of manuscript and newspaper images.

                <p class="abstract">
                    In this paper, we explore and evaluate the use of ranking-based objective functions for learning simultaneously a word string and a word image encoder. We consider retrieval frameworks in which the user expects a retrieval list ranked according to a defined relevance score. In the context of a word spotting problem, the relevance score has been set according to the string edit distance from the query string. We experimentally demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed model on query-by-string word spotting for both handwritten and real scene word images. We also provide the results for query-by-example word spotting, although it is not the main focus of this work.

                <h4>Task Arithmetic in the Tangent Space: Improved Editing of Pre-Trained Models</h4>
                <p class="abstract">
                    Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a cost-effective and scalable approach to edit pre-trained models directly in weight space: By adding the fine-tuned weights of different tasks, the model's performance can be improved on these tasks, while negating them leads to task forgetting. Yet, our understanding of the effectiveness of task arithmetic and its underlying principles remains limited. We present a comprehensive study of task arithmetic in vision-language models and show that weight disentanglement is the crucial factor that makes it effective. This property arises during pre-training and manifests when distinct directions in weight space govern separate, localized regions in function space associated with the tasks. Notably, we show that fine-tuning models in their tangent space by linearizing them amplifies weight disentanglement. This leads to substantial performance improvements across multiple task arithmetic benchmarks and diverse models. Building on these findings, we provide theoretical and empirical analyses of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) of these models and establish a compelling link between task arithmetic and the spatial localization of the NTK eigenfunctions. Overall, our work uncovers novel insights into the fundamental mechanisms of task arithmetic and offers a more reliable and effective approach to edit pre-trained models through the NTK linearization.
